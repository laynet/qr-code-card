## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

After working with so much ReactJS, I wanted to go back to my roots and see if I could still build something with the basics. This was my first time using Parcel, which I prefer to gulp for small projects. I have also been using Bootstrap grid almost exclusively in my career and wanted a refresher on CSS grid and flexbox. 

### Continued development

I like to have a library of front-end components, like this card, that I can use in other projects.
